# Networking Fundamentals #1

In this particular assignment, I extended my knowledge of IP addresses, honing my skills in manipulating them through the implementation of Bash scripts.

## Objectives ðŸ“„

* **0. Altering your Home IP**
  * [0-change_your_home_IP](./0-change_your_home_IP): A Bash script designed to configure an Ubuntu server with the following settings:
  * `localhost` mapping to `127.0.0.2`
  * `facebook.com` mapping to `8.8.8.8`

* **1. Displaying Connected IPs**
  * [1-show_attached_IPs](./1-show_attached_IPs): A Bash script tasked with presenting all active IPv4 IPs on the machine.

* **2. Monitoring Port Activity on localhost**
  * [100-port_listening_on_localhost](./100-port_listening_on_localhost): A Bash script engineered to listen on port `98` exclusively on `localhost`.
